TODO list
1. some way to implements microorganism into itemform
2. some method to extract them from that includes sereval machines that only work in Labratoray multiblock based on their contamination level
3. the microorganisms have danger level so alike to radioachtive materials they would hurt the player and contaminate based on their danger level so a way to set that would be benificial
4. the dilima of DNA, how? why? do we even need Genetic data...
manipulating microorganism is a huge part that i won't miss a chance from it but any approch of DNA indepth seems inconvinient so i won't shoot far and dont go crazy. but we need the bases
5. The Bases include machines and devices the labs to work in it's not a big issue and it's straight forward the only issue is how to use cultures to cultivate the desired spicies, an Incubator and greenhouse is great method to approch this. and yes they all operate in a lab. a laminar hood is especifically used for eukariot cells for example.
6. the Biochemistry is the most straightforward part except we use agents of living matter since these reactions kick of with help of living things and proteins not in chemical reactors so i don't just make a Carbs Cycle inside a chemical reactor since that looks stupid but tempting. instead reaction such as synthetising Agar for culture is interesting and many other ones which i should research more about

 - Mix some dirt,wtaer and biomass to get a simple Lake Water, take a sample under a microscope to determain the germs inside it, a normal lake sample countains varius types of Proteists (eukario) and some bacteria small animals and viral samples the latter ones being much rarer and harder to determain with low level microscope

Microscopes are a way to scope samples and determain the germs inside them higher level microscope can determain much rarer and smaller microorganisms
I am thinking of adding the microscope similar to an scanner
but it's used to give samples as well
Samples are gathered from Unknown Materials such as a lake water sample that's "scanned" to gather some microorganisms from it, for example by inspecting a 100mb of a lake sample you might leaaarn that i countains a large sample of echrichia coli and some water mold (a type of protesit of the clade Oomycetes it acts like a mold but in water and it's not related to real molds or fungis in anyways) or lava (or some better choice i find later like sulfur) have extermophile archeabacters live in them that are used to provide very heat resistance Enzymes such as the famous PCR enzyme heavially used in Genetic Engeneering

second steps:
 - to operate with the microscope you need to place the desired fluid (sample as we talked before) in it with some pepeard lamel on a lam, the lammel plate will be used once a microorganism have been extracted (regardless if it was successful or not) and the result will be placed on it for further study on the living being. to pepear a lammel you need to craft a lammel (a very thin plastic) on a lam (a half sized glass) made from thin plastic and glass in a press respectively they also need some water to attach 
the resulted lammel with possible microorganism needs to be studdied further to learn more about its traits?
I wanna avoid making a new Bee mechanic tough

- let player mess around with any sequence of DNA they desire 
the sequence correspond with IRL aminoacids and commands (like start and stop AUG UGA UAA)  so some are useless you can accidently find a good polypeptid but it would be useless without reasearching and testing the polymere to figure out its optimal tempeture and its gain as an enzym 
after you reasearch the desired peptid you need to use PRC (Polymerase Reaction Chain oh boi) and begin duplicating it trough intense heat (PRC is heat resistance) for use in synthesis chamber using Bacterias specialized to produce the peptid that can do the packaging and convert it to usable proteins which you can use in your BioGreenHouses or something haven't decide how you gonna use them yet, probably they gonna stay in microorganism and cultivate there in laminar cultivators, the possibilites are huge
oh also don't worry you don't have to randomally enter DNA sequences or google them, you can study them by analyzing already in game organisms to aquire and even reverse engeneer some proteins and make better version of them
