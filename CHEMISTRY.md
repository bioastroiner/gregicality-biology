- Halichondrin B is a polyether macrolide originally isolated from the marine sponge Halichondria okadai by Hirata and Uemura in 1986.[1] In the same report, these authors also reported the exquisite anticancer activity of halichondrin B against murine cancer cells both in culture and in in vivo studies. Halichondrin B was highly prioritized for development as a novel anticancer therapeutic by the United States National Cancer Institute[2] and, in 1991, was the original test case for identification of mechanism of action (in this case, tubulin-targeted mitotic inhibitor) by NCI's then-brand-new "60-cell line screen"[3][4] The complete chemical synthesis of halichondrin B was achieved by Yoshito Kishi and colleagues at Harvard University in 1992,[5] an achievement that ultimately enabled the discovery and development of the structurally simplified and pharmaceutically optimized analog eribulin (E7389, ER-086526, NSC-707389).[6][7] Eribulin was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on November 15, 2010, to treat patients with metastatic breast cancer who have received at least two prior chemotherapy regimens for late-stage disease, including both anthracycline- and taxane-based chemotherapies.[8] Eribulin is marketed by Eisai Co. under the tradename Halaven. 

> We definitely need biomineralization peptides, they could be used to obtain whatever element/compound you need, mix them with plant DNA and you get some sort of Mystical Agriculture addon. Could also be used to improve certain properties of organic matter, like tensile strength or hardness
